===== Niven Web for App =====

Writing the HTTP part for an app that uses a webservice is absolutely painful.

This is the solution that will alow you to write simple RESTful server side services and generate code for client side (Android an iOS which I am familiar with).

The aim is not to be a powerful framework as Spring or Struts, but to be a simple to use solution for small scaled project.
